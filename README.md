# Sweeparr

**Close the loop on your media library.** Request → Acquire → Watch → Age → **Warn → Remove.**

Sweeparr is a single, lightweight, self-hosted microservice that watches your Jellyfin / Jellyseerr /
Sonarr / Radarr stack and *schedules* stale media for removal — visibly, reversibly, and on a grace
period — instead of silently nuking files. It never touches the filesystem directly; every deletion
goes through the Sonarr/Radarr APIs so your `*arr` state stays consistent.

> **Rules start disabled.** Create a rule, use the live preview to see what would match, then turn it
> on when you're ready. A global **System** toggle in Settings can pause all evaluation and deletions
> without touching individual rules.

---

## Design tenets

- **Visible before destructive.** Everything appears on an *Upcoming Removals* board with a countdown
  and a one-tap **Keep** long before anything is deleted. The grace period *is* the safety model — no
  approval-gate friction, just an easy veto window.
- **Preview before enable.** Rules are created **off**. The condition builder shows a live preview
  (full match list) with no side effects until you explicitly enable a rule.
- **One system switch.** Pause the whole engine from Settings — no rules evaluate and nothing deletes
  while the system is paused.
- **Never touch the filesystem.** Deletions flow through Radarr/Sonarr (unmonitor → delete files →
  verify), with optional import-list exclusion so nothing silently re-downloads.
- **Auditable.** Every state transition, keep, and deletion is written to an append-only audit log.
- **Idempotent jobs.** The scheduler can crash, restart, and re-run without double-deleting.
- **One container, one volume.** SQLite (WAL) at `/config`. No external database, broker, or cache.

## Architecture

| Layer      | Tech |
|------------|------|
| Backend    | FastAPI · Uvicorn · SQLAlchemy 2 (async) · APScheduler · httpx · Pydantic v2 |
| Storage    | SQLite (WAL, single-writer) at `/config/sweeparr.db` |
| Frontend   | React 18 · Vite · Tailwind · TanStack Query · Recharts |
| Deploy     | One multi-stage Docker image, one `/config` volume |

The React SPA is built into `backend/static/spa` and served by the same FastAPI process, so there is
exactly one thing to run.

                    │                            ▼                          ▼

                                                                         │
                                                          execute_deletions (paranoid path)
```

### Lifecycle states

`ACTIVE → SCHEDULED → DELETING → DELETED`, with `KEPT` (vetoed) and `ERROR` as off-ramps. TV is
handled at **season** granularity; movies as a whole.

### Sync jobs

| Job | Interval | What it does |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| `sync_radarr` | 45 min | Upsert movies from Radarr; refresh disk-usage gauges |
| `sync_sonarr` | 45 min | Upsert series/seasons from Sonarr; refresh disk gauges |
| `sync_jellyfin` | 45 min | Link Jellyfin IDs; pull per-user watch stats (`UserData`) |
| `sync_jellyseerr` | 30 min | Ingest request metadata |
| `aggregate_playback` | 15 min | Roll up playback sessions into watch facts |
| `evaluate_rules` | 8 h | Match enabled rules against the library |
| `execute_deletions` | 1 h | Delete units past grace (when system is on) |
| `notify` | 1 h | Reminder notifications |
| `sync_leaving_collection` | 1 h | Jellyfin "leaving soon" collection |
| `housekeeping` | 24 h | Prune old playback events |

On first boot with an empty library, Sweeparr automatically runs library syncs when Sonarr or Radarr
are configured. Saving an integration in **Settings** also triggers the relevant sync jobs
immediately.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set session secret + admin password at minimum
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open <http://localhost:8000>.

1. Sign in with the **local admin** credentials from `.env` (`SWEEPARR_ADMIN_USERNAME` /
   `SWEEPARR_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
2. Go to **Settings → Connections** and enter your Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, and Jellyseerr URLs and
   API keys. Click **Save** on each service — this probes the connection and runs an initial library
   sync.
3. Create rules under **Rules**, preview matches, then toggle a rule **on** when satisfied.

You can also sign in with **Jellyfin administrator** credentials once Jellyfin is configured.

## Local development

```bash
# from repo root — copy and edit env first
cp .env.example .env

# backend
cd backend
python3.12 -m venv ../.venv && ../.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
set -a && source ../.env && set +a
../.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# frontend (separate terminal; proxies /api to :8000)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Build the SPA into the backend static folder for production-like testing:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables (bootstrap only)

See [`.env.example`](.env.example). These are read at startup:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SWEEPARR_TIMEZONE` | `America/New_York` | Schedule + countdown timezone |
| `SWEEPARR_SESSION_SECRET` | — | Signs session cookies (set a long random value) |
| `SWEEPARR_ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Local admin username (created on first boot only) |
| `SWEEPARR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `admin` | Local admin password (change after first login) |
| `SWEEPARR_{JELLYFIN,JELLYSEERR,SONARR,RADARR}_{URL,API_KEY}` | — | Optional: seed integrations into DB on first boot |
| `SWEEPARR_NTFY_URL` / `_TOPIC` | — | Optional: seed ntfy notification settings |

Integration URLs and API keys are stored in the **database** after first boot. The Settings UI is
the source of truth — env values only seed missing entries once. API keys are never returned in full
by the API (only `has_key: true`).

### Settings UI (runtime)

Managed in the admin **Settings** page and persisted in the `settings` table:

- **Connections** — Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Sonarr, Radarr, ntfy (test + save per service)
- **System** — global on/off (`system_enabled`); when paused, no rules evaluate and nothing deletes
- **Job schedules** — view next run time and manually trigger any sync or lifecycle job
- **Account** — change local admin password

## Authentication

| Method | Who | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Local admin | Username + password from `.env` | Bootstrapped on first run; password changeable in Settings |
| Jellyfin pass-through | Jellyfin admin users | Uses `/Users/AuthenticateByName`; requires Jellyfin configured |

The admin console is the only authenticated UI. Household members can still **request to keep** media
via magic links (`/keep/:token`) surfaced in Jellyfin inject banners — no separate login required.

## Rules

Rules are **off by default**. Workflow:

1. **Create** — pick a preset (stale movies, never-played requests, etc.) or start blank
2. **Build** — condition tree with live preview (click preview to see the full match list)
3. **Enable** — schedules matching units for deletion after the grace period
4. **Disable** — reverts scheduled units back to `ACTIVE`
5. **Delete** — removes the rule and reverts its scheduled units

The rule engine evaluates against materialized **watch facts** (plays, last watched, completion %,
requester activity, disk pressure, tags, etc.). See `GET /api/v1/rules/catalog` for the full field
list.

## In-Jellyfin integration

- **"Leaving Soon" collection** — surfaced natively via the Jellyfin API.
- **Pills & banners** — drop the versioned inject script into your Jellyfin web client:

  ```html
  <script src="http://<sweeparr-host>:8000/static/inject/sweeparr.js"></script>
  ```

  It reads only public-safe fields from the cached `/flags` endpoint, renders a "Leaving <date>" pill
  plus a dismissible banner with a one-tap **Request to keep** deep-link, and fails silently on any
  Jellyfin DOM change.

## Safety model in one paragraph

Nothing is deleted the instant a rule matches. An **enabled** rule promotes matches to **SCHEDULED**
with a grace countdown visible on the dashboard, in Jellyfin, and via notifications. Anyone can
**Keep** during the window; a keep request pauses deletion until an admin decides. Only after the grace
period — and only while the **system is running** — does `execute_deletions` re-verify protections
and call Radarr/Sonarr. The whole path is logged. Disabling a rule or pausing the system stops new
scheduling; existing scheduled items can still be kept or manually unscheduled.

## Upgrading

Sweeparr runs lightweight SQLite migrations on startup (`db.py`). Existing databases from older
versions are migrated automatically — legacy `CANDIDATE` units become `ACTIVE`, armed rules become
`enabled`, and removed columns (`status`, `dry_run_since`) are dropped.
